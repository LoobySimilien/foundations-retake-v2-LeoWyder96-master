# Foundations Final Retake Checkpoint

Please read the instructions below carefully. We assume you still have Testem installed; if not, please run `npm install -g testem`.

## Starting

* Clone your repo to your local machine.
* Run `testem` to run the tests
It's just like TestFirst!

---

## Procedure

### Rules

This checkpoint is similar to the Test First exercises â€” reverse engineer each spec, and write code to pass it. **Do not alter** any of the TestSpecs unless instructed to do so; ***all solutions should be written in the empty `.js` files in each folder***.

### Scoring

This checkpoint is scored out of **40 points**. In each suite, the later specs are usually more challenging / valuable. The suites are weighted as follows:

- 00_remove - 5.00 Points
- 01_vehicles - 6.00 Points
- 02_guesserPrank - 6.00 Points 
- 03_mapRight - 6.00 Points (the recursion spec is worth 3.00 out of the 6.00)
- 04_sentenceMaker - 5.00 Points
- 05_getNext - 7.00 Points

### Tips

* Each folder has a README.md file; **read the README files** to get an overview of each Test Spec and Point Value, as well as problem concept.
* You are encouraged to `git commit` at regular milestones.

## Submitting

When time is complete or when you finish the code, perform the following:

1. Commit all your changes with `git commit -am "submission for deadline"`.
* **Also**: `git push` your commits back up to your repository on Github.

Good luck!
